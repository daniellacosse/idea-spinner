## quick start

```sh
# download the workspace
git clone https://github.com/daniellacosse/idea-spinner.git
cd idea-spinner

# link dependencies
yarn

# start the dev server
yarn watch
```

## tour (wip)

- monorepo using yarn 3 and typescript
  - apps are platform-specific services
  - packages are resuable javascript modules (they shouldn't contain any platform-specific APIs)
- web app using vue 3
- trunk development
- valid scripts are all in root package.json
  - to run a script on a specific package, `yarn workspace <package name> <script name>` e.g. `yarn workspace @idea-spinner/storybook build`

## setting up VSCode (wip)
yarn 3 makes it a bit funky in places so we opted to not support vscode directly (for now)

1. Install recommended plugins. (Why?)
2. Create your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```
{
  "typescript.tsdk": ".yarn/sdks/typescript/lib"
}
```
